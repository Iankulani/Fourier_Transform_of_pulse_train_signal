# Fourier_Transform_of_pulse_train_signal
This repository provides MATLAB code for generating a Pulse Train Signal and computing its Fourier Transform. The function fourier_transform_pulse_train.m generates a periodic pulse train and calculates its Fourier Transform, which can be visualized in both the time and frequency domains.
